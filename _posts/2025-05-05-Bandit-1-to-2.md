## Solution:
Login to bandit1 using ssh by password you found at level 0 at port 2220.

It will take you to home directory of bandit1.

List the content of directory.

the file is `-` you found which you can not access directly cause it is used for redirection of input and output.

To access the file mention the full name of file with directory.
```ssh
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-

bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ~/-
263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit1/-
263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
```
{: .nolineno}

The password for level one is `263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx`

> Create you own file to store the passwords of previous levels along with little description how did you find them so that in case the passwords are changed you need not to start from zero.
